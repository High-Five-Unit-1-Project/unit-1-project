                <h2>CURRENT EFFECTS:</h2>
                <h4>CLIMATE CHANGE</h4>
            </div>
            <p>Fast fashion’s impact on the planet is immense. Fast fashion’s negative impact includes its use of cheap, toxic textile dyes—making the fashion industry the one of the largest polluters of clean water globally, right up there with agriculture. Cheap textiles also increase fast fashion’s impact. Polyester is one of the most popular fabrics. It is derived from fossil fuels, contributes to global warming, and can shed microfibres that add to the increasing levels of plastic in our oceans when washed. Conventional cotton requires enormous quantities of water and pesticides in developing countries. This results in drought risks and creates extreme stress on water basins and competition for resources between companies and local communities. The constant speed and demand mean increased stress on other environmental areas such as land clearing, biodiversity, and soil quality. The processing of leather also impacts the environment, with 300kg of chemicals added to every 900kg of animal hides tanned. The speed at which garments are produced also means that more and more clothes are disposed of by consumers, creating massive textile waste. According to some statistics, in Australia alone, more than 500 million kilos of unwanted clothing ends up in landfill every year. It's estimated that 92 million tons of textile waste is created annually by the fashion industry. It’s also said that textile waste is to increase by around 60% between 2015 and 2030, with an additional 57 million tons of waste being generated annually, reaching an annual total of 148 million tons.

            <h6 class="stat">STATISTICS</h6>
            <p>Fast fashion emits 1.2 billion tons of CO2 per year, more than air travel and shipping combined. Fast fashion produces 20% of global wastewater, contaminating rivers, oceans, drinking water and soil. 60% of clothes are made of synthetic materials derived from petrochemicals. These do not decompose, but rather break down into smaller and smaller fragments called microfibers. IUCN estimates between 0.6-1.7 million tons of microplastic fibers end up in the ocean every year. One garbage truck of clothes is burned every second (2,625 kilograms). Discarded clothing made of synthetic polymers can sit in landfills for 200 years</p>

                <h4>HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES</h4>
            </div>
            <p>As well as the environmental cost of fast fashion, there’s a human cost. Fast fashion impacts garment workers who work in dangerous environments, for low wages, and without fundamental human rights. Further down the supply chain, the farmers may work with toxic chemicals and brutal practices that can have devastating impacts on their physical and mental health, The industry’s widespread exploitation of garment workers constitutes, in the words of Business of Fashion contributor Bandana Tewari, “modern-day colonialism”. And ultra fast fashion brands appear to be taking the industry’s deplorable record to new lows. For their track records on labor, in particular, these brands again receive the lowest marks. We’ve found zero evidence that any of these brands pay living wages—100% of these brands fail to disclose any meaningful information about forced labor and the wellbeing of the workforce. And watchdog groups have found that the situation is dire. With SHEIN’s suppliers, for example, a late 2021 report from NGO Public Eye revealed that workers were putting in 75 hour weeks, receiving only one day off per month, and pay</p>

It is a five year independent, legally binding agreement between global brands and retailers and trade unions designed to build a safe and healthy Bangladeshi Ready Made Garment (RMG) Industry, originally signed in 2013 after the Rana Plaza building collapse which killed more than 1,100 workers and injured many more, revolutionized factory safety inspections in Bangladesh.</figcaption>

                <h4>ANIMAL CRUELTY</h4>
            </div>
            <p>Animals are also impacted by fast fashion. In the wild, the toxic dyes and microfibres released in waterways are ingested by land and marine life alike through the food chain to devastating effect. And when animal products such as leather, fur, and even wool are used in fashion directly, animal welfare is put at risk. As an example, numerous scandals reveal that real fur, including cat and dog fur, is often being passed off as faux fur to unknowing shoppers. The truth is that there is so much real fur being produced under terrible conditions in fur farms that it’s become cheaper to produce and buy than faux fur.</p>
