            <h2>PATHWAYS TO CHANGE</h2>
            <p>But what has emerged from Rana Plaza and the sustained conversation about fashion is a movement against this. A growing cohort of consumers who are behaving as citizens; people who are no longer satisfied with opaque supply chains, the unethical treatment of people, and the pollution of our environment. More than ever before people want to know the dirty little secrets behind the brands, and who they can buy from with a clear conscience.
                Hundreds of apparel corporations from around the world have signed the The Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh. The Accord ensures factories receive independent inspection and public reporting of the results. Many retailers, like Uniqlo’s owners Fast Retailing, were initially reluctant to commit to a binding agreement.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>WHAT CAN WE DO?</h4>
            <p>Buying Less is the first step—try to fall back in love with the clothes you already own by styling them differently or even “flipping” them. Why not turn those old jeans into some trendy unhemmed shorts, or give that baggy old jumper new life by turning it into a crop?
                Choosing Well is the second step, and choosing high-quality garments made of eco-friendly fabric is essential. Choosing well could also mean committing to shopping your closet first, only shopping second hand, and supporting more sustainable brands.
                Finally, we should Make It Last and look after our clothes by following the care instructions, wearing them until they are worn out, mending them wherever possible, then responsibly recycling them at the very end of their life.</p>
            <h6>reduce, reuse, recycle</h6>
            <h4>PROJECTIONS FOR THE FUTURE</h4>
            <p>As an increasing number of consumers call out the true cost of the fashion industry, and especially fast fashion, we’ve seen a growing number of retailers introduce so-called sustainable and ethical fashion initiatives such as in-store recycling schemes. These schemes allow customers to drop off unwanted items in “bins” in the brands’ stores. But it’s been highlighted that only 0.1% of all clothing collected by charities and take-back programs is recycled into new textile fiber.
                The underlying issue with fast fashion is the speed at which it is produced, putting massive pressure on people and the environment. Recycling and small eco or vegan clothing ranges—when they are not only for greenwashing—are not enough to counter the throw-away culture, the waste, the strain on natural resources, and the myriad of other issues created by fast fashion. The whole system needs to be changed.</p>
